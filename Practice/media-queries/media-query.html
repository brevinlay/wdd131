            <h2>Ether 12:4</h2>
            <p>
                Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place
                at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which 
                would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.

            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath 
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare 
                a way for them that they may accomplish thte thing which he commandeth them.
